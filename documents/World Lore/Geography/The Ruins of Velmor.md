# The Ruins of Velmor

The Ruins of Velmor stand as a testament to a civilization long forgotten. Located in the western reaches of Eldoria, these ancient ruins have puzzled scholars and adventurers for generations.

The structures that remain suggest a highly advanced society, with architecture that defies explanation. Massive stone blocks fit together with precision that seems impossible for the tools available at the time. Some believe the ruins predate recorded history entirely.

The site is shrouded in mystery and danger. Those who venture too deep into the ruins often report strange occurrences—whispers in languages unknown, visions of the past, and a sense of being watched by unseen eyes.

The Order of the Flame maintains a small outpost near the ruins, both to study them and to prevent unauthorized access. They believe the ruins may hold secrets that could be crucial to understanding Eldoria's past and future.

Few have dared to explore the deepest chambers of Velmor, and fewer still have returned to tell of what they found.
