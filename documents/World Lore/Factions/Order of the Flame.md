# Order of the Flame

The Order of the Flame is one of the oldest and most respected organizations in Eldoria. Founded centuries ago, its members are dedicated to protecting the realm and preserving knowledge.

The Order takes its name from the sacred flame that burns eternally in their main temple—a symbol of their commitment to enlightenment and protection. Members are chosen through a rigorous process that tests both their physical abilities and their moral character.

King Eldor is a member of the Order, having been initiated during his youth. The Order's teachings have greatly influenced his approach to leadership, emphasizing wisdom, justice, and the protection of the people.

The organization operates both publicly and in secret, maintaining libraries of ancient knowledge while also serving as advisors to the crown. They are known for their neutrality in political matters, always putting the good of Eldoria above personal interests.

During the Siege of Eldor, the Order played a crucial role in the defense of the capital, using both their knowledge of strategy and their mystical abilities to aid the kingdom.
