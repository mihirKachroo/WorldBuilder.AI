# The Royal Guard

The Royal Guard is the elite military force responsible for protecting the royal family and the capital city of Eldoria. They are among the most skilled warriors in the kingdom, trained from a young age in combat, strategy, and loyalty.

The Guard's history is intertwined with that of the crown itself. They have served every king since the founding of Eldoria, adapting their tactics and organization to meet the challenges of each era.

Under King Arion's rule, the Royal Guard was at its peak, with well-funded training programs and the best equipment available. However, following his death and the subsequent resource constraints, the Guard found itself stretched thin.

During the Siege of Eldor, the Royal Guard proved their worth once again, fighting valiantly to defend the capital. Their courage and sacrifice became legendary, and many of their members were honored for their service.

Today, the Guard continues to serve King Eldor, though they face ongoing challenges in maintaining their strength and readiness in a world that remains uncertain.
