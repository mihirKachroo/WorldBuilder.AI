# The Eastern Continent

The Eastern Continent is a vast and diverse landmass that lies to the east of Eldoria, separated by the Silver Sea. It is home to numerous kingdoms, city-states, and nomadic tribes, each with their own customs and traditions.

The continent is known for its rugged terrain, with mountain ranges that stretch across its northern regions and fertile plains in the south. The climate varies dramatically, from the harsh winters of the northern territories to the temperate zones of the central regions.

Historically, the Eastern Continent has been both a trading partner and a source of conflict for Eldoria. The relationship between the two regions has been complex, marked by periods of cooperation and tension. The recent unrest that led to the Siege of Eldor originated from political factions within the Eastern Continent who sought to expand their influence.

The continent is rich in resources, including precious metals, rare minerals, and fertile agricultural lands. This wealth has made it both powerful and a target for those who would seek to control its riches.
