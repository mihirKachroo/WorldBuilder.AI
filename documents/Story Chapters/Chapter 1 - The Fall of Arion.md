# Chapter 1: The Fall of Arion

The kingdom of Eldoria was once a beacon of peace and prosperity under the wise rule of King Arion. For three decades, he guided the realm through times of both peace and conflict, always with a steady hand and a compassionate heart.

But peace is fragile, and shadows were gathering on the horizon. The Eastern Continent had been restless, and whispers of rebellion reached the royal court. King Arion, ever the diplomat, sought to resolve tensions through negotiation rather than force.

It was during one such diplomatic mission that tragedy struck. The king's convoy was ambushed on the road to the Silver Sea, and King Arion fell defending his people. His death sent shockwaves through Eldoria, leaving the kingdom in mourning and uncertainty.

The crown passed to his son, Prince Eldor, who would become King Eldor. But the transition was not smooth. The young king faced challenges from all sides—political rivals, external threats, and the weight of his father's legacy.

Ten years would pass before the Siege of Eldor, a conflict that would test the new king's resolve and reshape the kingdom forever.
