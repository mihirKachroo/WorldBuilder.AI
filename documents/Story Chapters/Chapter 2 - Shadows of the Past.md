# Chapter 2: Shadows of the Past

In the years following King Arion's death, Eldoria struggled to find its footing. King Eldor, though young and inexperienced, proved to be a capable ruler. He surrounded himself with trusted advisors from the Order of the Flame, an ancient organization dedicated to protecting the realm.

The Royal Guard, once the pride of Eldoria, found itself stretched thin. With threats from the Eastern Continent growing, resources were diverted to border defenses. This left the capital vulnerable, a fact that would not go unnoticed by those who sought to exploit the kingdom's weakness.

Meanwhile, in the shadows, the Shadow Court watched and waited. This secretive organization had its own agenda, one that did not align with the interests of the crown. They moved in the spaces between light and dark, gathering information and influence.

As tensions mounted, it became clear that the peace King Arion had worked so hard to maintain was unraveling. The kingdom stood on the brink of war, and King Eldor would need to prove himself worthy of the crown his father had worn.
