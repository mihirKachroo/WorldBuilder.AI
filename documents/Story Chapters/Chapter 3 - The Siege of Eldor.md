# Chapter 3: The Siege of Eldor

The Siege of Eldor would become one of the most defining moments in Eldoria's history. Forces from the Eastern Continent, emboldened by years of perceived weakness, launched a coordinated assault on the capital city.

King Eldor, now ten years into his reign, had learned much from his father's example. He rallied the Order of the Flame, called upon the Royal Guard, and even found unexpected allies in the most unlikely of places.

The siege lasted for weeks, testing the resolve of both defenders and attackers. The city's walls, ancient and strong, held firm against the onslaught. But it was not just physical strength that won the day—it was the unity of the people, the wisdom of the king, and the memory of King Arion that inspired them to fight on.

When the dust settled, Eldoria had emerged victorious, but changed. The kingdom had proven its strength, but at a cost. The Siege of Eldor marked the end of an era of uncertainty and the beginning of a new chapter in Eldoria's story—one that would be written by King Eldor and those who stood with him.
