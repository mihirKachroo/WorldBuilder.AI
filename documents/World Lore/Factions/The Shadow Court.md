# The Shadow Court

The Shadow Court is a secretive organization that operates in the spaces between light and dark. Little is known about their true goals or membership, as they work in shadows and silence.

What is known is that they have existed for as long as recorded history, always present but never fully seen. They gather information, influence events from behind the scenes, and maintain a network of contacts that spans the known world.

Some view the Shadow Court as a necessary evil—a force that keeps the balance of power in check. Others see them as a threat to stability, operating outside the law and beyond accountability.

Their relationship with the crown has been complex. While they have never openly opposed the monarchy, they have also never fully supported it. They seem to follow their own agenda, one that may or may not align with the interests of Eldoria.

During the Siege of Eldor, the Shadow Court's role was unclear. Some believe they provided crucial intelligence that helped the kingdom survive. Others suspect they may have had a hand in the conflict itself.
